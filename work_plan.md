# Work Plan
##### Daniel Connolly, Qingmu Deng, William Fairman

1. Test Programs (10/24/18) ~1 hour
  - MIPS Assembly programs written and tested with MARS
  - exported `.dat` files for running in Verilog testbench

2. Block Diagram(10/26/18) ~3 hours
  - Very General to start
  - Get more specific as we need to implement different parts

3. Verilog Modules(10/29/18) ~3 hours
  - Basic module structure that can be presented at the midpoint check-in and stand as a good representation of our Verilog structure.

4. Midpoint Check-in(10/29/18) ~1 hour
  - We will check in before we begin to dive deep into the Verilog implementation for this lab. We hope to have the teaching team look over our block diagrams and our work plan. Given that we also have two other assignments due before the lab is due, we mainly hope to have a rather specific implementation plan at this point.

5. Processor-Test Benches (10/31/18) ~4 hours
  - A top level module wiring all submodules together(within one day of finishing the detail block diagram).
  - A high level test bench that allows the program memory to load instructions from `.dat` file.

6. Report(10/33/18) ~2 hours
  - Given the magnitude of this project, we anticipate finishing the report during time that literally doesn't exist (haha October 33).
